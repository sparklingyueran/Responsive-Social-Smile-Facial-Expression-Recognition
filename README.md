# Responsive-Social-Smile-Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial expression recognition fro Responsive Social Smile. This paper proposes a machine learning based assessment framework for early ASD screening. By integrating speech recognition and computer vision technologies, the proposed framework can quantitatively analyze children’s behaviors under well-designed protocols. We collect 196 stimulus samples from 41 children with an average age of 23.34 months, and the proposed method obtains 85.20% accuracy for predicting stimulus scores and 80.49% accuracy for the final ASD prediction. This result indicates that our model approaches the average level of domain experts in this ”Responsive Social Smile” protocol.
